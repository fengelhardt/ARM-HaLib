 *
 * \brief Management of the USB task either device/host or both.
 *
 * The USB task selects the correct USB task (USB device task or USB host
 * task) to be executed depending on the current mode available.
 *
 * According to the values of USB_DEVICE_FEATURE and USB_HOST_FEATURE
 * (located in the conf_usb.h file), the USB task can be configured to
 * support USB device mode or USB host mode or both for a dual-role device
 * application.
 *
 * This module also contains the general USB interrupt subroutine. This
 * subroutine is used to detect asynchronous USB events.
 *
 * Note:
 *   - The USB task belongs to main; the USB device and host tasks do not.
 *     They are called from the general USB task.
 *   - See the conf_usb.h file for more details about the configuration of
 *     this module.
 *
 * - Compiler:           IAR EWAVR32 and GNU GCC for AVR32
 * - Supported devices:  All AVR32 devices with a USB module can be used.
 * - AppNote:

//! @brief USB interrupt routine
//!
//! This function is called each time a USB interrupt occurs.
//! The following USB DEVICE events are taken in charge:
//! - VBus On / Off
//! - Start-of-Frame
//! - Suspend
//! - Wake-Up
//! - Resume
//! - Reset
//!
//! The following USB HOST events are taken in charge:
//! - Device connection
//! - Device Disconnection
//! - Start-of-Frame
//! - ID pin change
//! - SOF (or Keep alive in low-speed) sent
//! - Wake-up on USB line detected
//! - Pipe events
//!
//! For each event, the user can launch an action by completing the associated
//! \#define (see the conf_usb.h file to add actions on events).
//!
//! Note: Only interrupt events that are enabled are processed.
//!
//! Warning: If device and host tasks are not tasks in an RTOS, rough events
//! like ID transition, VBus transition, device disconnection, etc. that need to
//! kill then restart these tasks may lead to an undefined state if they occur
//! just before something is activated in the USB macro (e.g. pipe/endpoint
//! transfer...).
//!
//! @return Nothing in the standalone configuration; a boolean indicating
//!         whether a task switch is required in the FreeRTOS configuration
