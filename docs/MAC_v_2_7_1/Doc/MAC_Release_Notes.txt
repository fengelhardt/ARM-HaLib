    - Receiver can be switched on even if tal_state == TAL_SLOTTED_CSMA
  - Bug fix for receive buffer shortage and TAL queue overflow under high load conditions
- TFA:
  - Continuous transmission modes updated for CW and PRBS modes
- MAC:
  - Timestamp parameters in MAC-API in function usr_mcps_data_conf() and usr_mcps_data_ind()
    is removed as default for code reduction; timestamp is enabled again in MAC-API by setting
    compile switch ENABLE_TSTAMP

- AT86RF230B: Indirect data communication in beacon-enabled networks shows undefined behavior
- Early Radio Controller Boards (RCB) version 5.3 labeled without IEEE address do not have an
  IEEE address stored into the external EEPROM. Early Radio Extender Boards (REB) version 5.0
  might have external EEPROM values stored in the wrong format. Applications using these
  boards need to disable the build switch EXTERN_EEPROM_AVAILABLE and need to store an IEEE
  address into the first eight bytes of MCU's EEPROM.

- TFA Layer: Battery monitor (supply voltage measurement) read functionality added

Known issues
- Beacon-enabled networks: Power Management is not supported during inactive portions. Broadcast data is not indicated within beacons.
- AT86RF230B: Timestamp parameter of MCPS-DATA.confirm messages (usr_mcsp_data_conf) invalid
- AT86RF230B: Indirect data communication in beacon-enabled networks shows undefined behavior
- Early Radio Controller Boards (RCB) version 5.3 labeled without IEEE address do not have an IEEE address stored into the external EEPROM. Early Radio Extender Boards (REB) version 5.0 might have external EEPROM values stored in the wrong format. Applications using these boards need to disable the build switch EXTERN_EEPROM_AVAILABLE and need to store an IEEE address into the first eight bytes of MCU's EEPROM.

Release Version: 2.1.1
Release Date: Dec. 04, 2008
Build: 12438

System requirements for AVR-based MCUs - Supported Compiler/Tools
- WinAVR-20080610 release
- AVR Studio 4.14
- IAR Embedded Workbench for AVR version 5.11B

Supported devices
- AT86RF230A
- AT86RF230B
- AT86RF231
- AT86RF212
- ATmega1281
- ATmega1284P
- ATmega644P
- AT90USB1287
- ATmega2561
- ATxmega128A1 (rev.G)

Changes to previous version (2.0.3)
- TAL: support of AT86RF212 added
- SAL/STB: security support introduced
- PHY PIB phyTransmitPower is handled as defined by IEEE standard
- TFA: Functions tfa_cca_perform() and tfa_ed_sample() added
- High data rate modes introduced
- STB example application "Secure Remote Control" added
- STB example application "Secure Sensor" added
- TAL example application "Performance Test" added
- MAC and TAL library support removed

Known issues
- AVR GCC tool chain for Xmega: library bug with printf functionality
- Firmware that is larger than 64k created with WinAVR-20080610 GCC for ATxmega128A1 shows undefined behavior; e.g. 32 MHz oscillator cannot be enabled. In the current Xmega WinAVR tool chain (version WinAVR-20080610) there is a bug for images larger than 64k size. This will be fixed by setting the ramp Z register to 0 at program start. Once the tool chain is fixed this shall be removed.
- printf functionality provided by WinAVR-20080610 release used with ATxmega128A1 causes undefined behavior. This has impact to example applications, like Performance_Test.
- Early Radio Controller Boards (RCB) version 5.3 labeled without IEEE address do not have an IEEE address stored into the external EEPROM. Early Radio Extender Boards (REB) version 5.0 might have external EEPROM values stored in the wrong format. Applications using these boards need to disable the build switch EXTERN_EEPROM_AVAILABLE and need to store an IEEE address into the first eight bytes of MCU's EEPROM.
