MAC Example - Star


Setup
=====
The firmware for the MAC example "Star" can be created in three ways: Using the corresponding Makefile directly, executing the Makefile from the AVR Studio or building it from the IAR EWW.
Two nodes are involved in this example. Both nodes are operated using the same firmware.


Operation
=========
The first node searching for existing networks, and if no existing network is found on the default channel,
this nodes becomes the PAN Coodinator and creates a nonbeacon-enable network. This node has its receiver always
enabled.

Other nodes that find an already existing network, associate with the PAN Coordiantor and End Devices, and go
to both MCU and transceiver sleep. Once the button is pressed, the End Devices wake up again and send
data frames to the PAN Coordinator every 200ms. If the button is release again, the node goes to full
sleep again.
Please note that during sleep no timer is running at the MCU.
