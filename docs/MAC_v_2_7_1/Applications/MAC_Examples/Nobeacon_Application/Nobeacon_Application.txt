Nobeacon Application- Indirect(from Coord to dev) and direct(dev to Coord) trafiic


Brief Description

The basic MAC Example Nobeacon Application deploys a nonbeacon-enabled network.
The coordinator starts a PAN at channel DEFAULT_CHANNEL with the PAN ID DEFAULT_PAN_ID.
The device scans for this network and associates to the coordinator.
Once the device is associated, it uses a timer that fires every 5 seconds to poll for pending data at the coordinator by means of transmitting a data request frame to the coordinator.
On the other hand every 5 seconds the coordinator queues a dummy data frame for each associated device into its indirect frame queue.
If the coordinator receives a data request frame from a particular device, it transmits the pending data frame to the device.
Device after receiving the data from the Coordinator sends back the same data to the Coordinator itself by direct data transmission
The results of the proper data transmission/reception are printed to a terminal program via Serial I/O (UART or USB).

For demonstration purposes the coordinator's configuration is limited to associate two devices at maximum.
