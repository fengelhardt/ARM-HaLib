MAC Example : Beacon Application


Brief Description :

The basic MAC Example Beacon Application deploys a beacon-enabled network with star topology.
The coordinator starts a PAN at channel DEFAULT_CHANNEL with the PAN ID DEFAULT_PAN_ID.

The coordinator starts a beaconing network and transmits user data within beacon payload of transmitted beacon frames.
The device scans for this network,sync up with the coordinator and associates to the coordinator.The devices receive
these beacon frames, extract the receveived user data from the coordinator ,print the received data on the hyper
terminal and also sends the extracted beacon payload back to the coordinator.

The coordinator also transmits broadcast data frames periodically.The devices receive these broadcast data frames
and increase a counter.

The coordinator also puts the data in the indirect queue periodically and transmits data frames based on the
periodic poll request from the device.

The results of the proper data transmission/reception are printed to a terminal program via Serial I/O (UART or USB).

For demonstration purposes the coordinator's configuration is limited to associate maximum of 100 devices.
