TAL Example Wireless_Uart_2


Installation

Flash the file Wireless_UART_2.hex/Wireless_UART_2.bin to two nodes and connect
(via a serial connection, like USB or UART) the nodes to a terminal program. 

The example implements an alternate Wireless UART, based on the TINY_TAL 
Example Wireless_UART. It uses a timer to improve over-the-air-performance 
through sending data block-wise instead of transmitting frames upon every 
single byte received over the serial connection.

On the radio side, it deploys a nonbeacon-enabled network. 
Both nodes operate at channel DEFAULT_CHANNEL with the PAN ID DEFAULT_PAN_ID.
If the same short address settings is used, transmission problems may occur.

Terminal program settings: No flow control, local echo should be disabled.
