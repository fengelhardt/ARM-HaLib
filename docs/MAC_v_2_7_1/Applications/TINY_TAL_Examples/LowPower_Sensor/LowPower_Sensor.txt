TINY_TAL Example LowPower_Sensor


Installation

Take two nodes operating in the same RF band (either Sub-GHz or 2.4-GHz), one 
will become the receiver, the other the transmitter. For the latter, only 
deRFnode-based one are supported currently. 

Then flash the provided binaries into the respective devices. Connect the 
receiver node to your PC and open a terminal program (required settings:
115200kbit/s, 8N1, no flow control, the device manager tells you the required
virtual COM-Port number). 

Last but not least power up the transmitter node. It will periodically transmit 
its current sensor parameters to the receiver while sleeping most of the time.
By this, it perfectly suits battery-powered operation. (Powering it via DC- 
or USB is also possible of course, but does not make much sense. When using 
USB ensure the device drivers have been installed correctly, otherwise the 
device will not start up)!
