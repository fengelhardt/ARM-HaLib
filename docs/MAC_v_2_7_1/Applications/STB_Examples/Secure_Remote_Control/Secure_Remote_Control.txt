STB Example Secure_Remote_Control (based on TAL)


Installation

Flash the file Secure_Remote_Control.hex to two nodes and (if available) connect (via a serial connection, like USB or UART) the nodes to a terminal program.

Terminal program settings: No flow control.

The basic STB Example Secure_Remote_Control deploys a nonbeacon-enabled network using ZigBee/CCM* security. The example application is based on the TAL.
Both nodes operate at channel DEFAULT_CHANNEL with the PAN ID DEFAULT_PAN_ID and use the same short address settings. More than two nodes should not be operated with the same settings.

The application uses a button to initiate frame transmissions and LEDs to indicate the current status of the node.

Once the node is powered up the LED_0 switched on permanently. If the node is powered while the button is pressed, the application runs in unsecured mode (LED_1 is off). Otherwise (i.e. button is not pressed during system start-up) the application runs in secured mode (LED_1 is on).

If the button is pressed during operation, the node sends a frame which contains the message "Toggle light!". This message is either to be seen in plaintext or it is encrypted.

A node in secured mode only transmits frames being encrypted using ZigBee/CCM* security, and also expects frames being encrypted. A node in unsecured mode only transmits frames with plaintext, and also expects frames with plaintext.

If the transmitter has received an Acknowledgment frame as response to its frame transmission, it indicates the successful transmission by toggling the LED_2. If the transmission is not successfully, the LED_2 is flashing for a short time.

Receiver is in secured mode: If the node has received a secured frame, that could be decrypted properly, the LED_2 is toggled. If the received frame is either unsecured or has a security error (e.g. incorrect key), the LED_2 is flashing for a short time.
Receiver is in unsecured mode: If the node has received a plaintext frame, the LED_2 is toggled. If the received frame is secured, the LED_2 is flashing for a short time.

If a serial terminal is used, the used mode (security on or off) and the status of the last frame transmission or reception is printed.

Note: It is not recommended operating more than two nodes with the application simultaneously.
